This code merges and analyzes two datasets, one about mice and the other about the treatments for cancer they received. It looks at the efficacy of various drug regimens on tumor volume along with other mediating and moderating variables such as timepoint and mouse weight.

The code used in this challenge was developed by myself and the resources provided by the UMN Data Analytics bootcamp.
